# Machine-Learning-Models-from-Scratch

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas, bypassing the use of external libraries or frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

This approach offers several advantages over using pre-built frameworks:

* **Deeper Understanding of Machine Learning Concepts:** 

Building models from scratch provides a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of machine learning algorithms. You'll gain insights into the inner workings of these algorithms, including their mathematical formulations, optimization techniques, and performance evaluation metrics.

* **Enhanced Flexibility and Customization:**

By avoiding external frameworks, you gain complete control over the implementation of your models. This allows for greater flexibility in adapting algorithms to specific tasks and tailoring them to unique datasets.

* **Improved Debugging and Troubleshooting:**

Building models from scratch simplifies debugging and troubleshooting. You'll be able to pinpoint the exact source of any issues directly within your code, rather than navigating through complex framework-specific errors.

* **Reduced Computational Overhead:**

NumPy and Pandas are highly optimized libraries for numerical computations, making them efficient for building basic machine learning models. This can be particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments.
